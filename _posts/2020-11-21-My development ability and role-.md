Hi guys today I'm gonna analyze my development ability and role!

{: .box-note}
1) My development ability


I have been studying double major for 1 year and I have been working on 2 school projects in total, and I am working on 2 projects this semester.
I have experience using c and java and this is my first time using Python. 
But our project is free-python-games, and I've developed two games last semester.
I once developed a rhythm game using java during Java programming Lab, and once I developed a mole game using JavaScript.
Therefore, I can participate hard in developing games.

2) My role in Team 9


My strength is that I can communicate very well. And I do my best to participate in the team project.
So, I'm not the team leader of the 9th team, but I think I'm showing as much participation and leadership as the team leader.
I am currently writing a personal blog. So I'm very interested in managing the static page.
Also, since I am fluent in English, I think it can be a great help in translating docs.
And as I said above, I can participate in game development as well.

I'll do 'A personal contribution plan and plan summary based on my development capabilities' in the next post.
Thank you
