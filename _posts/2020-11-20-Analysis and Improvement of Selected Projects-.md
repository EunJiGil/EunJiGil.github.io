Hi guys Today, I am going to analyze the selected topic and think about the direction of improvement in detail. 

1. Analysis of Selected Projects 

Our project is **free-python-games**. This project is simple games **made for education**. Currently, there are 15 games in total.

### Free-python-games

Starting in 2012, Free Python Games began as an after school program to teach programming to inner-city youth. 
The goal was to have fun as much as it was to learn. Since then the games have been improved and used in a variety of settings ranging from classrooms to summer day-camps. The games run anywhere Python can be installed which includes desktop computers running Windows, Mac OS, or Linux and older or low-power hardware such as the Raspberry Pi. Kids across the United States in grades 6th-12th have enjoyed learning about topics such as encryption and projectile motion through games. Each game is entirely independent from the others and includes comments along with a list of exercises to work through with students. Creativity and flexibility is important. There is no right or wrong way to implement a new feature or behavior! You never know which games students will engage with best.

Currently, there are 15 games in total, and I will show them briefly below.


**Paint**
Paint -- draw lines and shapes on the screen. Click to mark the start of a shape and click again to mark its end. Different shapes and colors can be selected using the keyboard.

**Fidget**
Fidget -- fidget spinner inspired animation. Click the screen to accelerate the fidget spinner.

**Tiles**
Tiles -- puzzle game of sliding numbers into place. Click a tile adjacent to the empty square to swap positions. Can you make the tiles count one to fifteen from left to right and bottom to top?

**Connect**
Connect -- Connect 4 game. Click a row to drop a disc. The first player to connect four discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins!

2. Improvement of Selected Projects 

{: .box-note}
We decided on the direction of improvement as follows.

Currently, there are 15 kinds of games in total, and we are contributing to the students' access to more diverse games. 
Therefore, we investigate games that are not among the current types of games, select a game and develop it together. And we create a tutorial that helps novice students by documenting basic functions of Python or simple logic structure that is implemented in the game.

Therefore, we divided our improvements into 10 categories.

1) Organizing opinions presented to the community and organizing them on the static page (using a timeline)
2) Planning and developing games
3) Creating educational documents for developed games
4) The role of leading the overall workflow of the team and modifying the overall commit (commit manager)
5) Finishing the introduction of team members and projects on the static page
6) Posting production that describes the game we develop on the static page, features, etc.
7) Translating written educational documents into English
8) Managing Wiki pages
9) Modifing game bugs
10) Annotating Code

Among these roles, the roles I can contribute to will be posted again next time.

Thank you
