Hi guys today let me tell you about the progress of Team 9! We used the Github issues page to conduct several meetings.

**Note:** 1. Select a New Topic
The first topic was about selecting **a new topic for semester**. We've tried to use the product of the original topic for the past week. However, we needed an account to try out the product under the previous theme, but the whole team didn't receive the account, which led to the delay. So we asked our assistant if we could change the subject and found a new one. We revisited the opinions we presented last week and explored new topics. And we decided on a new project called Python Games as our semester theme. Below are the screenshots of our meeting.

**Note:** 2. Select a community and plan activities
We had a second meeting to select a community and plan our activities. We used 'Github issues' for a week, and we were really satisfied, so we chose github issues as our community. And we decided to subdivide our roles, and we found last year's data for reference. Also, we decided on the issues and considerations during the activity and listed the activities we needed.
