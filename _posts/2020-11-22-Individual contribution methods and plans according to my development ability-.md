I am going to talk about individual contribution plans and planning arrangements based on my development ability.

{: .box-note}
1. Individual Contribution method


1) Organizing opinions presented to the community and organizing them on the static page (using a timeline)

**2) Planning and developing games**

**3) Creating educational documents for developed games**

4) The role of leading the overall workflow of the team and modifying the overall commit (commit manager)

5) Finishing the introduction of team members and projects on the static page

**6) Posting production that describes the game, features, etc we develop on the static page.**

**7) Translating written educational documents into English**

8) Managing Wiki pages

9) Modifing game bugs

10) Annotating Code

Out of 10 categories, they are 4 methods that I can contribute to. 
I selected it based on my development ability and project experience, and please refer to my past posting for me.
I'm going to plan when I can do it one by one.
